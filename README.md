For my first project at General Assembly I was inspired to make Taylor Swift-themed Tic Tac Toe Board. My objectives were as follows: 

 - Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
 - Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
 - Use your programming skills to solve the game logic for a game
 - Code an interactive game that allows a user to play tic tac toe against themself
 - Communicate with a back-end (which we'll provide for you) to store the state of your game.
 - Craft a README.md file that explains your app to the world


Planning Story
I used the requirements that General Assembly laid out to guide me:

Application Requirements: 

 -User must be able to sign up
 -User must be able to sign in
 -Signed in user must be able to change password
 -Signed in user must be able to sign out
 -Signed in user user must be able to start a tic tac toe game
 -When playing game, user must start as X and then rotate between X and O
 -When playing game, user must only select available spaces on the board
 -When playing game, user must be notified when win, loss or tie occurs
 -Once a game is over, user must not be able to add to that board
 -Once a game is over, user must be able to play again
 -Signed in user must be able to view number of games played

API:

 -Sign up POST /sign-up
 -Sign in POST /sign-in
 -Change password PATCH /change-password
 -Sign out DELETE /sign-out
 -New game POST /games
 -Update game PATCH /games/:id
 -View number of games played GET /games
 -Give feedback to the user after each action's success or failure.
 -All forms must clear after submit success

User Stories:
-as a user, I want to see a sign up form so that I can create an account.
-as a user, I want to use a sign in form so that I can log into my account.
-as a user, I want to be able to have a change password form so that I can change my account password.
-as a user, I want a new game button so that I can start a new  game of Taylor tic tac toe.
-as a user, I want to be able to click directly on the board so that I can choose where to place my X or O.
-as a user, I want a sign out button so that I can close out my account.

Technologies Used
-jQuery
-HTML/CSS
-Bootstrap
-Javascript
-Ajax

Unsolved Problems
I was not able to figure out how to determine a winner and that halted my progress.
