For my first project at General Assembly I was inspired to make Taylor Swift-themed Tic Tac Toe Board. My objectives were as follows: 

 - Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
 - Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
 - Use your programming skills to solve the game logic for a game
 - Code an interactive game that allows a user to play tic tac toe against themself
 - Communicate with a back-end (which we'll provide for you) to store the state of your game.
 - Craft a README.md file that explains your app to the world


Planning Story
I used the requirements that General Assembly laid out to guide me:

Application Requirements: 

 User must be able to sign up
 User must be able to sign in
 Signed in user must be able to change password
 Signed in user must be able to sign out
 Signed in user user must be able to start a tic tac toe game
 When playing game, user must start as X and then rotate between X and O
 When playing game, user must only select available spaces on the board
 When playing game, user must be notified when win, loss or tie occurs
 Once a game is over, user must not be able to add to that board
 Once a game is over, user must be able to play again
 Signed in user must be able to view number of games played

API:

 Sign up POST /sign-up
 Sign in POST /sign-in
 Change password PATCH /change-password
 Sign out DELETE /sign-out
 New game POST /games
 Update game PATCH /games/:id
 View number of games played GET /games
 Give feedback to the user after each action's success or failure.
 All forms must clear after submit success

User Stories:
as a user, I want to see a sign up form so that I can create an account.
as a user, I want to use a sign in form so that I can log into my account.
as a user, I want to be able to have a change password form so that I can change my account password.
as a user, I want a new game button so that I can start a new  game of Taylor tic tac toe.
as a user, I want to be able to click directly on the board so that I can choose where to place my X or O.
as a user, I want a sign out button so that I can close out my account.

Technologies Used
jQuery
HTML/CSS
Bootstrap
Javascript
Ajax

Unsolved Problems
I was not able to figure out how to determine a winner and that halted my progress.
